// Deprecated: CORS is now configured centrally in SecurityConfig.corsConfigurationSource().
// This file intentionally left as a no-op to avoid dual CORS configurations that can
// cause conflicting headers and 403 on preflight. If needed in the future, re‑enable
// WebMvcConfigurer here, but prefer SecurityConfig for API CORS.
